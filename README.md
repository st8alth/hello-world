# hello-world

this is a sample file in a sample repository to get to grips with the git hub environment

OK, so now this is an edited file because the tutorial told me to do it.  IT also said to write about myself but that's not going to happen, I'd rather just twitter on about nothing in particular than do that.

Oooo I have just orderd me a Raspberry Pi, PiGlow and Pi Camera.

I intend to play wit the pretty lights and record them o nthe camera.  Once I finish tinkering the intent is to make a CCTV camera with email notification based on movement and activate the LEDs in a flashing manner when someone approaches the house from the front.  Should be interesting to see if it works as easy as I hope it will!
